# Accessibility-hw

## Description 

The goal of this project is to add semantic HTML, ensure the HTML elements follow a logical structure, add accessible alt attributes for icon and image elements, ensure the heading attributes fall in sequential order, and give the title element a concise, descriptive title.

## Usage

Practice changing HTML and CSS code to make it more readable and accessible, and optimize for search engines, without changing the way it displays. This skill is essential to becoming a full stack developer.
